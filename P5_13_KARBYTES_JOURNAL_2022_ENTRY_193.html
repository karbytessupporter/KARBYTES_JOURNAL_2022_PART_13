<p>Once upon a time, there was a person named A and a person named B. A and B happened to be living in the same metropolis. B happened to be a slick salesperson and impersonator of a doctor. A happened to be a gullible and naive customer. B sold A the lie that smoking cigarettes would improve the respiratory health of A. A bought the lie and smoked daily expecting to see an improvement in A&#8217;s respiratory functioning. As the weeks wore on, A felt worse and worse and then developed lung cancer. Long story short: A was shocked, dismayed, and horrified to learn that A was diagnosed with terminal cancer as a result of smoking cigarettes. Person C happens to be reading this story. Person C said that A deserved to suffer from terminal cancer as a consequence of not being more self-educated and willing to take better care of itself than to trust its health and safety and future into the hands of scam artists like B. Person D also happens to be reading this story. D feels sorry for A and believes that A was doing the best it can given its unique circumstances and limitations (and that the universe A lives in happens to be a deterministic clockwork universe in which events unfold in a manner which is 99% predictable because all future events have probabilities which are functions of empirical evidence about the past and present state of the universe in which A resides). D feels sorry for A, B, C, and D for that reason. D posits that all four of those persons are prisoners of fate and each lack free will (and that degrees of relative free will within the confines of determinism are equally illusory (i.e. that hierarchies of control are illusory and that all information processing agents are equally powerless to control any events)). Person E happens to be reading this drivel (and watching karbytes write it). E is open to alternatives to determinism and is able to entertain multiple competing hypotheses about any phenomenon.</p>

<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">One thing which I am implicitly promoting via publishing personal websites (and backing up each page of those websites to the <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet Archive</a> using the <a style="background:#00ff00;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WayBack Machine</a>) is the idea and practice of any person (and potentially all persons) creating their own personal religions (and documenting the source code to their own personal religions as personal websites which they save to the Internet Archive). People can design, build, and test their own religions and share documentation about their personal religions on the World Wide Web for all persons to see and to gather inspiration and ideas from.</span></p>
