<p>29_SEPTEMBER_2022: Thoughts While Day Traveling: Some pages of my primary website (i.e. Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com) such as PUBLIC_DOMAIN and BITS_AND_BYTES seem okay to leave in their current state while other pages such as NATURE need to be modified and maybe even split into multiple pages to cover the complex topics that one page tries to encompass. I am currently working on a new page named PANPSYCHISM, a new page named SOLIPSISM, and a new page named IDENTITY. I am considering removing the pages named KARBYTES_ETHICS, DISCLAIMER, SOLAR_ENERGY_TOKENS, and TECHNOCRATIC_UTOPIA. I am tentatively planning on updating the pages named AGENCY, MULTIVERSE, and NUMBERS. My goal is to get those particular modifications to my primary website done before Monday (i.e. 03_OCTOBER_2022). I intend to finalize each page of that entire website before the end of the year (i.e. 01_JANUARY_2023). <span style="background:#ffff00;">Next year I will probably add more pages to that website which mostly (if not exclusively) pertain to computer programming, calculus, and epistemology. I will most likely discontinue attempting to add pages to that website which are about ethics or economics.</span></p>
<p>Note: To see what the Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com website looked like on 10_SETPETMBER_2022 (which includes the pages of the primary website which I plan to modify or else remove), see the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/primary_website_copy_10_september_2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRIMARY_WEBSITE_COPY_10_SEPTEMBER_2022</a> page of this website (i.e. Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com).</p>
