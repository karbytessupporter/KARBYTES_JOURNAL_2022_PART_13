<p>29_SEPTEMBER_2022: To make a long story short, I decided to return the petroleum powered minivan I was borrowing from my parents back to my mother&#8217;s driveway with the intent to rely on walking, BART, and other environmentally sustainable commute methods for now on. I told myself that, for now on, I will limit my job search to jobs which are within a reasonable walking distance of a BART station. As I settled down into my camping spot at Horsey Hill tonight to reply to a friend&#8217;s comment on Instagram and to &#8220;like&#8221; content in my Instagram feed, I was suddenly informed that my Instagram account is suspended for violating community guidelines and I will have to wait 30 days for the chance to re-access it. A friend I met through Instagram who has also become a friend on my Facebook account stated that one of his poems got censored off Facebook for being to controversial.</p>
<p>I am not sure whether a human or else a robot flagged my Instagram account but I am displeased with the censorship enough to give up on trying to have a content-oriented Instagram account and will, instead, just create a very minimalist Instagram account which I use almost exclusively to consume news which I find interesting. I will update the Instagram links on my personal websites to that new &#8220;bland&#8221; account which will only have nine images total.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I just created a new account and will proceed to populate it with exactly nine (&#8220;non controversial&#8221;) images and then follow accounts I whose content I want to populate my news feed.</p>
<p>Never mind. As soon as I tried to verify the third Instagram account I have ever &#8220;owned&#8221;, the system suspended that account as well and then required me to submit more verification about my (human) identity. That convinced me to remove the Instagram links featured on the home pages of my personal websites and to give up on using Instagram. I will keep using Twitter and Minds as my primary social media platforms (read and write) and will look outside of those websites for news and media which pertains to my interests (and make my @karbytes Twitter and Minds my own brand of news aggregator).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>To make matters even worse, I noticed that my headphones are missing and the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">psychotronic harassment</a> is causing me more distress than normal. About an hour ago I felt tired, sleep deprived, and ready to settle in for a nice night. Now I feel agitated, ganged up, and cornered by bullies in a world which seems more hostile to me than it is to most other people around me. I do think that other people are trying to rob me of satisfaction and deprive me of healthy coping mechanisms. Perhaps the biggest issue pertaining to &#8220;the war on Karlina&#8221; is the fact that people disapprove of me being able to spend so much of my time outdoors as a party of one. Choosing to walk instead of drive a car seems to be controversial with the people because walking (especially by myself at night) is something other people (especially women) seem to be against doing.</p>
<p>I do believe that society is &#8220;rigged&#8221; to prevent people from being able to spend much time outside of a container where they are free to use their legs to travel relatively freely and their senses to perceive details in the environment which would otherwise be missed.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I started playing a piece of recorded music out loud. Then the pack of coyotes nearby started howling and yapping. Well, that was nice. That gave me some sorely needed comfort. Meanwhile, the crickets are providing a continuous auditory stimulus for my mind to focus on (so that I can relax and get some sleep).</p>
