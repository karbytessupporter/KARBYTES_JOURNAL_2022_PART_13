<p>I checked my email and saw that my background check with Amazon has been completed. I logged into the Amazon jobs page and was able to re-select the same shift schedule I had before I was booted off the &#8220;waiting list&#8221; for that schedule without warning. My tentative start date with Amazon is close to November. Meanwhile, I still have other job interviews scheduled and I seemed to have a successful interview with Creator, Inc while sitting by The Tree at Horsey Hill talking to some guy named Ian.</p>
<p>It is overcast today. Yesterday I made some significant edits to my primary website (Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com) and I plan to work on it more today and tomorrow since I have no job interviews this weekend. I have decided that it would be in my best interest to resume driving the Toyota Matrix my parents have allowed me to borrow so that I do not have to spend so much time commuting and having to dance around the BART train schedule (and BART opens late and closes early on Sundays which might make it hard for me to get to work and to leave work unless I camp close to work).</p>
<p>Rather than lug my big backpack around with tent in tow, I think it is better if I only carry my current backpack (which is big but not so big that it seems like a hindrance if I have to stow it at whatever facility I end up working at) and leave my tent and other supplies which I only occasionally use in the car. If and when I get around to purchasing a bicycle, I will probably use that bike to commute some days when the whether is good and during normal BART hours.</p>
