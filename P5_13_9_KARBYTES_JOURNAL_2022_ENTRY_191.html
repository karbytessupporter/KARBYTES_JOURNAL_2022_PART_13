<p>On my Instagram, Twitter, Minds, and even Facebook accounts I removed the images and quotes I posted within the past week of my wearing a backpack, the &#8220;jizz&#8221; drawing I made today, and the Buddhist monk advice quote I posted today because each of those posts, in my opinion and in hindsight, seem to be insinuating that I feel depressed and not exactly living up to my personal standards. The image I am trying to promote of myself (and my personal brand) online is one which invokes in my audience (self included) a sense of optimism, hardiness, survivalism, love of science, appreciation of nature, and psychonautics.</p>
